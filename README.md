# sfsr
An `R` package for analysing population-genetic data represented as the site frequency spectrum (SFS)

## background
The *site frequency spectrum* (SFS; also known as the allele frequency spectrum) is the histogram over allele counts in a population.  More formally, for a population consisting of $N$ chromosomes, the SFS is an the vector $\mathbf{\zeta} = \zeta_0, \zeta_1, \dots \zeta_N$ whose entries correspond to the number of sites at which $0, 1, \dots N$ copies of the drived allele are segretating in the population.
